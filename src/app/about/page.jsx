        <p>
          Welcome to PetQuest! Your ultimate companion in finding and adopting
          pets! Our mission is to create a seamless and compassionate platform
          where people can connect with animals in need of loving homes.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl font-medium padding-y">Our Mission</p>
        <p>
          At PetQuest, we believe that every animal deserves a chance to find a
          loving family. We aim to bridge the gap between homeless pets and
          potential adopters by providing a user-friendly platform for sharing
          and discovering pets up for adoption. Our goal is to make the adoption
          process easier, more transparent, and accessible for everyone.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl font-medium padding-y">How It Works</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Post a Pet for Adoption: Have a pet that needs a new home? Whether
            you&apos;re a rescue organization, shelter, or an individual, you
            can easily post pets for adoption. Simply create a post for the
            animal with details such as age, breed, and personality traits, and
            upload some photos to help them stand out.
          </li>
          <li>
            Discover Your New Best Friend: Browse through a diverse selection of
            pets looking for homes. Use our intuitive search and filter options
            to find pets that match your preferences. Whether you&apos;re
            looking for a playful puppy, a cuddly cat, or a more exotic
            companion, PetQuest has you covered.
          </li>
          <li>
            Enquire About Adoption: Found a pet that captures your heart? Fill
            out a simple enquiry form to express your interest in adopting. Your
            enquiry will be sent directly to the pet&apos;s current caregiver,
            who will get in touch with you to discuss the next steps and answer
            any questions you might have.
          </li>
        </ul>
